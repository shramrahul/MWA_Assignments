use of setImmediate instead of setTimeout

setTimeout is simply like calling the function after delay has finished. Whenever a function is called it is not executed immediately, but queued so that it is executed after all the executing and currently queued eventhandlers finish first.

setImmediate is similar in this regard except that it doesn't use queue of functions. It checks queue of I/O eventhandlers. If all I/O events in the current snapshot are processed, it executes the callback. It queues them immedieately after the last I/O handler somewhat like process.nextTick. So it is faster.

Also setTimeout will be slow because it will check the timer at least once before executing. At times it can be twice as slow.
